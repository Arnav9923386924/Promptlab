    Question: Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between
    a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate
    and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client
    certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client
    and server don’t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of
    the following attacks does TLS protect against?

    1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.

    2. An attacker impersonating the server.


    A) True, True

    B) False, False

    C) True, False

    D) False, True'

    Question: MIT’s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours
    (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no
    longer be used?


    A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients
    and servers for expired tickets.

    B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate
    the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket’s
    maximum lifetime.

    C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket’s expiration
    time to the server’s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the
    ticket expiration time is in the past.

    D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to
    check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC’s clock, and refuses
    to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.'
